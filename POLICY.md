# KS Extension Submission Policy

1. **Multiple Extensions Accepted**
   - You may submit multiple extensions for mobile testing daily.
   - Extensions will be placed in either `mobile_succeeded` or `mobile_failed` after testing.

2. **Testing Time**
   - Standard: 1 hour per extension.
   - Partial success (≥79% working but contains bugs): 6 hours testing.
   - Fully successful extensions are moved to `mobile_succeeded`.
   - Failed extensions are moved to `mobile_failed`.

3. **Compatibility**
   - Extensions submitted for mobile are expected to work with mobile environments (Pythonista, Pydroid, Termux).
   - Results may vary due to device limitations.

4. **Disclaimer**
   - KS Language extensions are **not `.hsx`**.
   - Extensions may not behave as expected on all devices.
   - Contributions are welcome and encouraged.
